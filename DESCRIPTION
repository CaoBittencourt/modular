Description: modular helps to write modular code in R. It is meant to be used with packages such as box or regular source commands by providing an absolute path to a project's root which is objetive and consistent across files and working directories. Therefore, if one calls the project.root function from any file whatsover, modular will either find a local project root or create one. Unless specified, it will then set the working directory to the project root. Thus, all paths can be objectively referenced from it.
